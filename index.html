			<h3>How You Like Me Now</h3>
			<p>	Now there was a time
				When you loved me so
				I could have been wrong
				But now you needed to know
				See, I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad man
				And I'm in deep, Yes I am
				I found a brand new love for this man
				And I can't wait till you see
				I can't wait
				<br>
				So how you like me now
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				<br>
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				<br>
				Remember the time
				When I eat you up
				You know that I wasn't lyin'
				that you can't give up
				So if I was to cheat
				on you baby would you see right through me
				If I sing a sad, sad, sad, sad song
				would you give it to me
				<br>
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				<br>
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				<br>
				Does that make you love me baby
				Does that make you want me baby
				Does that make you love me baby
				Does that make you want me baby
				<br>
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
				How you like me now
